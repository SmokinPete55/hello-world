# hello-world
Initial repository
This is new to me. I have coded over 30 years ago before this was available and there have been many technological advancements as well. I am currently a Robotics Mentor for a Robotics Team in Prosper Texas. They are currently in transition due to splitting the school into another High School. There will be a combined team The RoboTalons which will be students from both Prosper High School and Rockhill High School.
I have embarked on this new questto finish a project that funny enough started about the same time that Gael Langevin started InMoov. I had backed off at that time because I was Mentoring Team 1287 in Myrtle Beach annd a student was wanting to work with a robotic hand and rather than seem to be incompetition with her I chose to table my project. I now find that Gael was working on the same project and has advanced through the years to a fully working Humanoid Torso. That is extremely exciting to me.
I plan on following his builds and try to capture as much information along the way that I can. I hope also to pull others in to assist in the build as well as look at other forms of uses for the robot in  the end. I'm excited also that he has chosen to leave this open sourced and look forward one day, if possible to meet him inperson.
